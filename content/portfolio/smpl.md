#### Project Overview

Working in close collaboration with San Marcos Public Library staff to understand their information needs, I analyzed 10 years of collection, circulation, and patron data with particular focus on understanding how COVID-19 impacted library services. The project transformed raw circulation data into actionable insights about collection performance, patron behavior, and service utilization.

**Data Analyzed:**
- 3.9 million circulation transactions
- 122,000 collection items across multiple formats
- Patron demographics and usage patterns
- Pre-pandemic and COVID-era service data (with emphasis on 2019-2021)

**Key Findings:**

**COVID-19 Service Impact:**
- Hold pickups and same-day holds increased 4-6x during pandemic restrictions, revealing crucial shift in patron behavior
- Demonstrated library's adaptation to contactless service models

**Collection Performance Analysis:**
- DVDs and children's books showed highest circulation rates relative to collection size
- Identified acquisition/circulation mismatch: library excelled at adding adult non-fiction titles but these showed lower circulation compared to collection growth
- Periodicals significantly underutilized - high acquisition rates but low circulation, suggesting opportunity to reallocate budget

**Patron Demographics:**
- Age-based breakdowns revealed usage patterns across different patron segments
- Insights into which demographics engaged with different collection types

**Technical Approach:**
- Cleaned and structured decade of circulation data in Excel and Tableau
- Built interactive dashboards enabling librarians to filter by collection type, date range, and patron demographics
- Designed visualizations for both executive stakeholder reporting and operational collection management
- Applied performance analysis techniques to compare acquisition rates against circulation patterns

The dashboards provided library leadership with data-driven insights to inform acquisitions strategy, collection development priorities, and service planning in the post-pandemic environment.

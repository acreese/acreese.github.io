#### Client Churn, Retention, and Tenure Dashboard Series

I developed a series of interactive dashboards in Power BI to analyze client behavior and churn patterns for a service-based non-profit. By building a data model and using custom Power Query transformations, I created dashboards to track key metrics such as churn rates, client retention after orientation, and client tenure. These dashboards provide insights into client activity across various locations and services, enabling leadership to make data-driven decisions that optimize resource allocation and operational efficiency. Additionally, they explore variables like client demographics and service usage, offering a comprehensive view of client engagement.

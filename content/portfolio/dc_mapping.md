**Project Overview:**

This comprehensive site analysis map was created for a proposed demolition and redesign of RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., providing multi-scale spatial context for urban planning and landscape architecture decisions.

**Technical Approach:**
- Integrated multiple GIS datasets: parks, waterways, marshlands, roadways, building footprints, and tree canopy
- Processed large-scale spatial data to create cohesive visualization of city's ecological and infrastructural systems
- Designed custom cartographic labels and color schemes in Adobe Illustrator for clarity at multiple scales
- Applied principles of hierarchical information design to balance detail with readability

**Key Features:**
- Multi-layer spatial analysis showing relationship between natural and built environments
- Detailed zoom views demonstrating precision at site-specific scale
- Color-coded ecological zones (waterways, marshlands, tree cover) integrated with urban infrastructure
- Professional cartographic presentation suitable for stakeholder communication

The map demonstrates proficiency in urban GIS analysis, multi-dataset integration, and cartographic design for large-scale planning projects.

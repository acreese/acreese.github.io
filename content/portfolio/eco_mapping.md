**Project Overview:**

This topographical site analysis map was created for a landscape planning study at Cornell University, combining multiple spatial data layers to provide comprehensive environmental context for campus development decisions.

**Technical Approach:**
- Processed GIS data layers including elevation contours, circulation networks, and building footprints
- Created custom tree canopy overlay in Adobe Illustrator to represent existing vegetation patterns
- Applied cartographic design principles to balance technical accuracy with visual clarity
- Integrated topographic, architectural, and ecological information into unified site analysis visualization

The map demonstrates skills in spatial data visualization, multi-layer GIS analysis, and cartographic composition, uniting environmental data with aesthetic design for landscape architecture planning.
